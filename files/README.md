These are files that were changed during reverse engineering (and also any changes that may be necessary for this software to work).

Any of these with a `**` next to them are necessary to be replaced. 
Any required changes as noted will be handled by [the cloudbit-builder installer](https://github.com/littleBitsman/cloudbit-builder).

Make sure you "save state" of your drive before doing any modifications on your own in case something happens.

Consider the root directory of the cloudBit SD card `~` for all of these.

- `onBoot.sh`: `~/usr/local/lb/bit-util/onBoot.sh` **
- `cloudclient.service`: `~/usr/lib/systemd/system` **
