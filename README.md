# cloudbit-software
Firmware for the littleBits CloudBit (which was deprecated) so that it can connect to a server.

*This version is intended to communicate with a local (in your home network) server.* 
*If you are looking to use the main server, check the `main` branch.*

## stats
This version has not been tested yet.
Expected usage is as follows:
- CPU: < 5%
- Memory: < 0.5MB

## quick start
**You need any computer that is able to mount a ext2 or ext3 filesystem, like Linux or a Mac, for any steps following this. Windows has downloadable tools from the Internet to do this, but use them *at your own risk*.**
**I HEAVILY recommend saving an image of the current state of the drive, using tools like `dd`, before installing.**
1. mount your cloudBit SD card (the root of the mount will be referenced as `~`)
2. download the binary `cloud_client`
3. copy it into `~/usr/local/lb/cloud_client/bin`, renaming the already existing file if you wish to keep it as a backup or overwriting
4. done!

**If you want the binary to use a different server than the default, do the following:**
1. create a file `~/usr/local/lb/cloud_client/server_url`
2. put the FULL URL in the file, including `ws://` or `wss://` at the start - if the URL is invalid the default will automatically be used

**To build manually:**
1. clone the full GitHub repo from `main` (root of this directory will be referenced as `./`)
2. install the Rust tools for your OS if you don't already have them (`rustup`, `cargo`, etc.)
3. run `rustup target add armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi`
4. run `cargo install cross`
5. run `cross build --release --target armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi`
6. your binary will be found at `./target/armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi/release/cloud_client`

## protocol details
UDP is a connectionless protocol; as such managing each cloudBit on your own server implementation may be difficult.

Each message in both directions ALWAYS has the first 12 bytes being the respective bytes in the MAC address (as in, bytes 0 and 1 maps to the first component of the MAC address).

The bytes are as follows:
```
 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|             MAC ADDRESS           |IO|VALUE|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                                     |    |
                                     |    |
I -> Input, O -> Output -------------'    |
Input/Output value -----------------------' - A 16-bit unsigned integer is expected for output, the input is always an unsigned 8-bit integer.
```

If bytes 12-14 do not exist, then the packet can be considered an `IDENTIFY` packet.
