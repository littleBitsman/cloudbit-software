# cloudbit-software
This version is intended to communicate with a local (in your home network) server. If you are looking to use the main server, check the `main` branch.

Firmware for the littleBits CloudBit (which was deprecated) so that it can connect to a server created with the NPM package `cloudbit-server`.
more stuff coming soon
